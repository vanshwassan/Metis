# Oracles

Oracles are newly-designed capabilities that connect blockchains to external systems. Accordingly, on-chain smart contracts will execute the code based on the inputs that are coming from off-chain sources. Metis is partnered with Oracle providers and gives you different options to use the leading Oracle systems within the Ethereum blockchain. These are the most valuable Oracle providers that work seamlessly with the Metis ecosystem:
